            In the Winter of 2013, Founders Matt Slater and ______ started building CoinDash to provide a professional derivatives market in the Bitcoin economy.  As Bitcoin users, enthusiasts and traders, they saw the need for a Bitcoin derivatives market and decided to build it themselves.  6 months, endless redbull and a lot of gray hair later, CoinDash was born. </p>
